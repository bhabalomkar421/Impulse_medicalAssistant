AUTOMATIC ACCIDENT DETECTION AND AMBULANCE RESCUE SYSTEM.

Nowadays the road accidents in modern urban areas are increased to uncertain level.
The loss of human life due to accident is to be avoided. Traffic congestion is a major fact that causes delay to 
ambulance. 

The idea behind this is to implement a system which would control mechanically the 
traffic lights in the path of the ambulance. 

Students can build a controller that identifies the location 
of the accident spot through the sensor systems in the vehicle which determined the accident and 
thus the controller walks through the ambulance to the spot.
