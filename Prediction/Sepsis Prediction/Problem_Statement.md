PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Sepsis is a severe life-threatening disease that is endangering most population all around the world. Sepsis is a major health issue, which eventually leads to death when it progresses to severe sepsis or septic shock. It is not only haunting developing countries but also countries like Western Europe and the United States as well. According to the World Health Organization [WHO], 30 million people become victims of this deadly disease of which 15-30 % of sepsis identified patients die, due to late medical diagnosis and late treatments. Despite the advancement in treatment for sepsis, no good improvement is seen as still 15-30% of sepsis patients die every year. Also, the mortality rate due to sepsis is higher and increasing linearly in many low and moderate-income countries. Thus, there is a need to implement a system that predicts sepsis accurately even before doctors. So, with advancements in technology, AI can help predict sepsis earlier and thus save numerous lives. In this way, patients with a high risk of sepsis can be predicted before its onset and severity.
